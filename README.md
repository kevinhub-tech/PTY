### About Project

This project was about learning how a prototyping team would operate in a system and what type of technology and method they would apply when they are executing their project. To be able to learn efficiently, the scenario was given to the students to consider ourself as a website developer. Here are the scanerio

- Develope a design for a community portal for software developers
- Engage with users to obtain feedback
- Iterate the prototyping process and refine the portal prototype.

As I have mentioned before, the project was entirely about learning about prototyping process and designing a portal. Therefore, there were no involvement of programming languages but we had a slight knowledge about angular Js.

### What I have done

The project was carried out in a team to form a prototype for the portal. On that matter, the learning process about prototypes were individually performed and was utilized when the designs were implemented. Here are few things that I had achieved.

- Enlighted upon the knowledge about different types of prototypes methodologies and different kinds of prototypes.
- Obtained imperceptible knowledge about Angular Js.
- Applied **Axure RP** to develope multiple versions of the prototypes.
- Developed Personas and profiles to implement the prototyping process with Gantt Chart and objectives

### Accomplishments

The developement for the prototypes were achieved after the module was completed and there were several versions resulted due to the iterated process of the project. Firstly, the first ever version of the prototypes were implemented quickly after reviewing the personas and project requirements and here is the sneak peak of it.
